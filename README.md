This project contains three datasets (originally created in Excel, later imported into PostgreSQL) personally created to practice SQL queries.
The datasets simulate a social media scenario and are structured as relational tables with relationships between them.

The goal of this project is to:
Learn and practice PostgreSQL syntax.
Explore concepts like JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY

Some of the questions that were answered in this project are:
